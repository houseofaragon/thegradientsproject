          The Gradients Project was created to blend different
          creative platforms. Our philosophy is that nothing in life is black
          or white, but a gradient. We explore this concept through
          various intersections and collaborations between mediums
          including (not limited to) visual art, design, dance, film, music,
          architecture, food, computer science, and more...
